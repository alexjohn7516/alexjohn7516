#### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Ever since I failed at making a [purchase bot](https://github.com/xelacast/all-in-one) to buy 1 30 series graphics card 3 years ago, I knew there were unlimited possibilities with software development.

- I've been coding in JavaScript and Python for 4 years and TypeScript for over 2 years
- I'm currently learning LangChain, FastAPI, and LLMs/OpenAI
